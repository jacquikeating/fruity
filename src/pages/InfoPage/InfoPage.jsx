        Hi, I'm Ella, amateur full-stack developer and worst player in my DSR
        static â€” and I've got the data to back that up. I struggled hard during
        DSR prog, which prompted me to start writing down my mistakes and the
        causes of our wipes. I realized that since I was calling out myself more
        than anyone else, I could share my google doc as a resource for everyone
        to benefit from. FRUity is an evolution of that idea.

      <p className="info-page__text">
        Or, well, as non-toxic as a giant list of our fuckups can be. The goal
        is not to shame people, but to give us a concrete picture of areas we
        can improve on. We're going in with the expectation that, collectively,
        we'll make hundreds of mistakes before we get everything right.
      </p>

      <h2 className="info-page__subheading">Subjective and imperfect</h2>
      <p className="info-page__text">
        All data comes from my personal observations, so it's prone to human
        error. Plus, some things are up to interpretation -- for instance, if
        two people kill each other with spread markers, is one person at fault,
        or are both equally responsible?
      </p>

      <h2 className="info-page__subheading">Collaborative</h2>
      <p className="info-page__text">
        We are a team of eight, and one person cannot be the single source of
        truth. If I get something wrong or if you disagree with my
        interpretations, I want you to let me know! Coming soon, you'll even be
        able to edit it yourself.
      </p>

      <h2 className="info-page__subheading">Continually growing</h2>
      <p className="info-page__text">
        This will probably look a little bit different each time you check in.
        I've got an endless list of tweaks, UI improvements, and new features to
        be added. Please look forward to it.
