## FRUity Overview
FRUity is a "prog log" developed for personal use by myself and my FFXIV ultimate raid static, Wall is Safe. What exactly is a prog log? It's a repository of data chronicling our journey as we progress through FFXIV's newest ultimate raid, Futures Rewritten (Ultimate), more commonly known as FRU.

## Objective
Ultimate raids are extremely complex boss encounters, at least 15 minutes in length, in which a team of 8 players must fail hundreds of times before they are finally able to eke out a victory. My team's last ultimate raid (Dragonsong's Reprise) took us a whopping nine months to complete! To accelerate our progress, I began keeping a manual Google Doc record of all of our attempts, which included the point of the fight we'd reached, the reason for our failure, and who was responsible. By analyzing this data, we were able to identify areas for improvement. FRUity is an evolution of that tool with a cleaner flow of information, better user experience, and advanced features that greatly enhance our ability to analyze and draw conclusions from our data.
